# TaskFlow – Advanced Task Management System

TaskFlow is a comprehensive task management system built using Express.js. It provides features like real-time task tracking, role-based access control (RBAC), task assignments, and much more. This project demonstrates advanced backend development practices, including authentication, real-time updates, and RESTful API design.

## Features

### User Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User)
- OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub

### Task Management

- Create, update, delete tasks
- Assign tasks to users
- Track task history and status changes
- Search and filter tasks by priority, status, and deadlines

### Real-Time Collaboration

- Real-time notifications and task updates using WebSockets (Socket.io)
- Collaborative task editing

### RESTful API

- Well-structured and documented RESTful API
- API versioning for future-proofing

### File Uploads

- Upload attachments to tasks (documents, images, etc.)
- Manage task-related files (download, delete)

### Email Notifications

- Task assignment and deadline reminder emails

### Advanced Error Handling & Logging

- Custom error handling middleware
- System event logging with Winston

### Containerization & Deployment

- Dockerized for easy setup and deployment
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shel
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskflow.git
cd taskflow
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shel
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the following environment variables:

```shel
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
DB_URL=your_database_url
CLOUD_STORAGE=aws_s3_or_cloudinary_url
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

4. Set up the database (PostgreSQL/MySQL or MongoDB):

```shel
# For Sequelize (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

# For Mongoose (MongoDB)
npm run db:init
```

5. Start the development server:

```shel
npm run dev
```

6. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000.`

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Postman or Swagger (mention which one you used). To explore the API:
